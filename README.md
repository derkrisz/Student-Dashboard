# Codeclan Student Dashboard:

An intranet dashboard for Codeclan students.
A place for students to access daily and weekly information - what the syllabus is for the week ahead, to be able to view the plan for future weeks and to see at a glance what events are happening internally that week.

The page is dynamic and displays information based on the date and time of the day. Students can see their full schedule and presented with the weekly breakdown of the schedule of each cohort. There is also a list of tech Meetups in Edinburgh, and a list of internal events of CodeClan in the near future. Meetup venues are displayed on Google maps. There is also a dedicated Careers section with employer partners and available jobs.

### MVP:
 - To show all the current cohorts weekly/daily schedule.
 - To be able to view the full syllabus by week.
 - To show the events that are taking place internally in any week.

### Extensions:
  - To be able to see what events are happening in the future (may be a calendar view)
  - To add links to PDA, Careers/Jobs, contact links to admin/homework submission etc.
  - To add data on local Tech Meetups using an external API, possibly with Map view.
  - And any other extensionsâ€¦
